I am currently a Research Engineer at [Kuaishou Technology](https://ir.kuaishou.com/) since 2020, working with [Ming Sun](https://msunming.github.io/)'s team, to enhance video quality on the Kuaishou platform. I received Ph.D. in Fluid Mechanics from Peking University in 2020, supervised by Prof. [Yue Yang](http://www2.coe.pku.edu.cn/subpaget.asp?id=489). Prior to this, I obtained my B.S. from Peking University in 2015.

My research interest includes generative models and image/video enhancement. I have published 10+ papers at top international AI conferences such as CVPR and ICML. I have also published in top fluid mechanics journals such as the Journal of Fluid Mechanics.
