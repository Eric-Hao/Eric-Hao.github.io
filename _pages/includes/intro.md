I am currently a research engineer in the Algorithms Research Center, Video Technology of [Kuaishou](https://ir.kuaishou.com/) <img src='./images/kuaishou-full.svg' style='width: 2.8em;'>, based in Beijing, China. I joined Kuaishou in 2020 and I am currently working in [Ming Sun](https://msunming.github.io/)'s team to evaluate and promote the quality of user-generated videos on the Kuaishou platform.

I received my Ph.D. in Fluid Mechanics from [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/) in 2020, advised by Prof. [Yue Yang](https://en.coe.pku.edu.cn/faculty/facultyaz/891197.htm). I also obtained my B.S. in [Mechanics](https://en.coe.pku.edu.cn/) and [Economics](https://en.nsd.pku.edu.cn/) (double major) from Peking University in 2015.

I'm interested in contributing to video/image processing (restoration and enhancement), generative models, and MLLM research. I have published 10+ papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hVMNCSQAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2FEric-Hao%2FEric-Hao.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a> at top international AI conferences such as [CVPR](https://cvpr.thecvf.com/), [ECCV](https://eccv.ecva.net/), and [AAAI](https://aaai.org/conference/aaai/aaai-25/). I have also published in top fluid mechanics journals such as the [Journal of Fluid Mechanics](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-fluid-mechanics).

If you are interested in any form of **academic cooperation**, please do not hesitate to contact me at [haojinhua@kuaishou.com](mailto:haojinhua@kuaishou.com). We are currently looking for interns to join our team!
