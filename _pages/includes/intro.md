I am currently a Research Engineer at [Kuaishou Technology](https://ir.kuaishou.com/). 
I joined Kuaishou in 2020 and I am currently working with [Ming Sun](https://msunming.github.io/)'s team, where we focus on promote the quality of user-generated videos on the Kuaishou platform.

I received my Ph.D. in Fluid Mechanics from Peking University in 2020 under the supervision of Prof. [Yue Yang](http://www2.coe.pku.edu.cn/subpaget.asp?id=489). Prior to this, I obtained my B.S. in [Mechanics](https://en.coe.pku.edu.cn/) and [Economics](https://en.nsd.pku.edu.cn/) (double major) from Peking University in 2015.

My research interest includes generative models, image/video restoration and enhancement, and multimodal large language models (MLLMs).
I have published 10+ papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hVMNCSQAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2FEric-Hao%2FEric-Hao.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=social&label=citations"></a> at top international AI conferences such as CVPR, ECCV, and AAAI. I have also published in top fluid mechanics journals such as the Journal of Fluid Mechanics.

If you are interested in any form of academic cooperation, please do not hesitate to contact me at [haojinhua@kuaishou.com](mailto:haojinhua@kuaishou.com). We are currently looking for interns to join our team.
